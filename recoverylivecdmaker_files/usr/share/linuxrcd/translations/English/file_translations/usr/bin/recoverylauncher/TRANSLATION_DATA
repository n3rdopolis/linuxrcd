@%@recovery cd introduction message@%@~~~~~~~~~~~This Live CD is used to recover broken Ubuntu systems, and POSSIBLY other distros. This CD is not offical from Ubuntu, but it should work. This is not meant to be a DATA recovery CD, to recover accedently deleted files. If you wanted a DATA recovery CD, use Photorec, and do not write anything to the filesystem that you deleted the files from, because the more you write to a filesystem the less chance that data recovery is possible. This is for recovering Ubuntu systems that are unusable instead.~~~~~~~~~~~DELIM_FOR_KDIALOG
@@@COMMENT@@@ this message should say that this a system recovery cd, that is not offical, and that it might or might not work on other distros, and that if the user needs a data recovery cd, they will need something like photorec, and instruct user to not write to the file system with this recovery cd if they needed a data recovery cd.~~~~~~~~~~~DELIM_FOR_KDIALOG

The non root browser, if accedentaly closed will automatialy restart as non-root. The Xephyr program also reopen if closed as root as they are root to begin with.~~~~~~~~~~~DELIM_FOR_KDIALOG

The Xephyr window will contain a GUI running as the system that you selected. Do not be alarmed that the GUI is different (as in not your standard desktop environment, whether its Gnome or KDE, or whatever you use). This Live CD uses its own GUI within the Xephyr Window. Whatever you do within the Xephyr window will affect the system you seleted to mount (such as using Synaptic within the Xephyr window to install a package).~~~~~~~~~~~DELIM_FOR_KDIALOG
@%@recovery cd web browser description@%@~~~~~~~~~~~The web browser is the only thing not running as root (so do not open a new one from the panel), and is there so you can search for solution on the web if you need help fixing your system.~~~~~~~~~~~DELIM_FOR_KDIALOG
