@%@Boot Message@%@~~~~~~~~~~~The Ubuntu Recovery CD will automatically boot in 10 seconds (unless you hit a key). If you dont want to boot this CD type hd, then hit enter to boot off your hard drive. If you want to boot to the recovery cd, and accedentaly hit a key, or you want to boot now, make sure there is no text after boot: and hit enter.
@@@COMMENT@@@ The above string should tell the user to wait 10 seconds to boot to the live CD, if they have not pressed a key, and should tell the user if they want to boot off their hard drive, to type the string hd and press enter, and if they accidentaly hit a key, or want to boot off the live cd instantly to clear all text, and hit the enter key
